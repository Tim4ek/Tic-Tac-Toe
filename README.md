# Tic-Tac-Toe Test Project

This repository contains the implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game for Unity. The project was developed using the following plugins and tools:

- **VContainer**: Used for dependency management and dependency injection.
- **UniRx**: Provides reactive programming, simplifying asynchronous and event-driven logic.
- **UniTask**: Enables working with asynchronous operations in Unity, making code more readable and manageable.
- **DoTween**: Utilized for creating animations and transition effects between game states.
- **ShaderGraph**: Allows for visually creating and editing shaders, facilitating the creation of graphical effects.
- **Unity Render Pipeline**: Employed for optimizing graphics rendering and resource utilization.
- **Addressables**: Utilized for managing game resources, providing more efficient resource loading and management.

The implementation includes the core game logic as well as artificial intelligence (AI) logic for playing against the computer. The minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a specified depth of search was used as the AI algorithm. This algorithm enables the computer to make optimal decisions in the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
